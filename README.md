PROJECT OVERVIEW:


Database Setup: I started by ensuring a clean slate with the database StudentGradesDB. This involved dropping the database if it existed and then creating it anew. This approach ensures that any previous data is cleared, allowing for a fresh start.

Table Creation: I defined two tables: Students and Grades. These tables are essential for organizing student information and their corresponding grades. Each table was carefully designed with appropriate columns and constraints, such as primary keys (StudentID for Students and GradeID for Grades).

Data Population: I inserted sample data into the Students and Grades tables. This step involved adding three students with their respective IDs, names, ages, and grades for various subjects. This initial data setup is crucial for testing and demonstrating queries.

Query Execution: I performed various SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data:

Select Queries: I listed all students and all grades to verify data insertion and correctness.

Join Query: I used a join operation to find all grades for a specific student (Alice Johnson), demonstrating how to retrieve related data from multiple tables.

Aggregate Query: I counted the number of students in each grade (A, B, C) for the subject Math. This query provides statistical insights into student performance.

Data Modification: I updated a grade (C to A) and deleted a record from the Grades table (Charlie Brown's English grade). These operations illustrate how to modify existing data based on specific conditions.


Problem-Solving Approach:

Structured Approach: I followed a structured approach by first setting up the database schema (CREATE TABLE statements), ensuring it meets the requirements for storing student and grade information efficiently.

Data Integrity: I maintained data integrity by defining primary keys and ensuring each table's data adhered to these constraints.

Query Optimization: I used SQL queries to extract meaningful information (SELECT statements), leveraging joins, aggregations (COUNT), and filtering (WHERE clause) to meet specific information needs.

Data Manipulation: I demonstrated proficiency in updating (UPDATE) and deleting (DELETE) records, which are essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date data.

In summary, through these steps, I've successfully set up a database, populated it with sample data, executed various SQL queries to retrieve and analyze information, and performed data modification operations. This approach ensures that the database is functional, the data is accurate, and queries are optimized for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
